# Tiny-ML-enabled-RL-based-Traffic-Infernce-
A reinforcement learning-based traffic signal control system designed to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion at intersections. This project utilizes deep reinforcement learning techniques to allow traffic signals to adapt dynamically to varying traffic conditions.
